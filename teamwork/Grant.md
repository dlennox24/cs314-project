1.What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
	My team will work together and get the projects done in an efficient and timely manner. 
2.What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
My personal goals for this semester is to get valuable teamwork and communication skills because my teamwork and communication skills aren’t very good. 
3.What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
We could encounter the problem of not being able to agree on everything, and someone maybe slacking off. We could also encounter the problem where we fight all the time and don’t get anything done.
4.What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
We have to compromise I feel that all my team members will be going for an A, but I feel we can work together to help each other all achieve A’s.
5.Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
Yes I feel it is acceptable for some members to work harder to achieve an A as long as that person is not doing all of the work.
6.How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
	I feel it will take about 7-9 hours a week to be successful on this project.
7.How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
I think our team is going to just do random activities unless one group member feels they are better at a certain section than others. 
8.What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
We will talk to that person make sure it doesn’t happen again but we will also rally and finish what we need to to get back on track. 
9.What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
We will work together to make sure that we agree on the quality of work we put out as a team. 
10.How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
I will work hard to accept these habits to make sure that all members feel comfortable at work.
11.Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
Yes I feel it is necessary to meet outside of class to do code reviews and make sure all tasks are caught up.
12.How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
	I think that once or twice outside of class and once in class should be enough.
13.Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
I feel that approval of every team member is necessary for a very efficient team but if we cannot agree then we should vote on the right way to get things done.
14.What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
Then we will do what the two want to do. Teamwork is about compromise and decision making not to get hung up.
15.How often will you rotate the facilitator position?  How will you decide on whose turn it is to facilitate?
	I think we will switch of facilitating until we find a facilitator that all three agree is the best.
16.What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
Ask him if he can help us understand what is going on so we can also be as successful as he is. 
17.What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
Embrace them and make sure that the group remains to run smoothly I do not mind having all the facilitator responsibilities. 
18.Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?  What hours?
I can be reached anywhere from 8am-10pm mostly by text or email unless we decide a different form of communication is best.
