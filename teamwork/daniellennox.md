I hope to accomplish our assignments on time and learn useful teamwork skills since this is probably the first time any of us have worked on code as a team.
I think the best way to improve teamwork is to ensure everyone is on the same page and knows what's expected. So having a choosing a form of communication that works for everyone and sticking to it would be best.
Everyone has different ideas as to how to best proceed with an issue or problem, which could cause issues if everyone isn't on the same page.
I think the others should be willing to help out with that but depending on the level of work required for that it might be a problem. I don't believe this will be an issue though.
I believe so. Though it shouldn't be a lot of extra work for that one person. I think it needs to be discussed as it may not be a problem at all.
Honestly, I don't know. It depends entirely on the project and our effectiveness as a team. CSU recommends spending 2-3 hours outside of class per credit per week on studying so that's a good starting point.
Discussion and communication. Base the workload off what each person wants to do and try to split everything as evenly as possible.
I don't think this will be an issue but I think that's a case by case situation.
It would be best to discuss what those differences are and figure out how to mitigate them.
As long as it works for them and they are meeting the deadlines we agreed on then it shouldn't be a problem
I think that might be a good idea. Though it would be best to discuss what is the easiest for the project at hand, especially for the frequency of them.
Assuming no class time is given for a meeting then at the start of each project, at least.
Depends on the weight of the decision. If it's pretty important to the project then it would be a good idea to at least discuss it. If it's minor to just their portion of the project then probably not.
Discuss the best way to compromise or if there is an entirely different and better way to solve the issue at hand.
It might be best to 'draw straws' to determine the order of the facilitator position and then rotate every project or cycle unless someone really wants to start it off.
I'm not entirely sure what this is asking but I'm assuming that it means they are really good at facilitating the team. If that's the case I'd still like to be able to take the reins from time to time just to get feedback from that person. If the third person doesn't want to take that role that would be fine with me, as long as everyone feels that it's fair.
Personally, I would be fine with that (as long as it's working), though I would ask the others if they wanted to give it a shot.
Email (or GitHub mentions) for general stuff will work, but for immediate responses, text/phone call is best. Generally, I'm almost always available after 4pm and weekends. I work during the midday and have classes at the start and end of the day. I can usually respond to short, high importance emails or texts while I'm at work.
